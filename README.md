## Overview

MindMap is the first component of the **DarwinCodex** suite - a collection of productivity tools designed specifically for developers. It provides an infinite canvas for visual thinking, architectural planning, and idea organization with a clean, dark-mode interface optimized for technical workflows.

## Features

### üé® **Visual Mind Mapping**
- Infinite canvas with smooth pan and zoom
- Bezier curve connections between nodes
- Dark mode optimized with subtle grid background
- Professional shadows and animations

### üß† **Developer-Focused Design**
- Clean, modern interface built for technical workflows
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid node creation
- Multi-select and drag operations
- Double-tap to edit node content

### üíæ **Document Management**
- Document-based app architecture
- Automatic save/restore functionality
- JSON-based file format for portability
- iCloud sync support (planned)

### üîß **Modern Architecture**
- Built with iOS 18+ and modern SwiftUI
- `@Observable` state management
- `ReferenceFileDocument` for proper document handling
- Cross-platform support (iPhone, iPad, Mac Catalyst)

- [ ] Shared data models and sync
- [ ] Workflow automation between tools

## DarwinCodex Suite

MindMap is part of the larger **DarwinCodex** project - a unified productivity suite for developers:

1. **MindMap** (this project) - Visual thinking and architecture planning
2. **CodeSnippets** (planned) - Swift/C++ code fragment management
3. **DevNotes** (planned) - Markdown-based documentation system
4. **DarwinCodex** (planned) - Unified interface combining all tools

## Technical Requirements

- **iOS/iPadOS:** 18.0+
- **macOS:** 15.0+ (via Mac Catalyst)
- **Xcode:** 16.0+
- **Swift:** 5.9+

## Architecture

### Modern SwiftUI Stack
- `@Observable` for reactive state management
- `ReferenceFileDocument` for document handling
- `Canvas` for high-performance drawing
- Gesture recognition for intuitive interactions

### Key Components
- **MindMapDocument**: Core observable data model
- **MindMapCanvasView**: Infinite canvas implementation
- **NodeView**: Individual node rendering and interaction
- **CanvasState**: Pan, zoom, and viewport management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 16.0 or later
- macOS 15.0+ for development

### Building
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lithalean/MindMap.git
cd MindMap
open MindMap.xcodeproj
```

Build and run for your desired platform (iPhone, iPad, or Mac).

## Usage

### Basic Operations
- **Create Node**: Press Space bar or double-tap empty canvas
- **Edit Node**: Double-tap existing node
- **Move Nodes**: Drag nodes around the canvas
- **Pan Canvas**: Drag on empty canvas area
- **Zoom**: Pinch gesture or scroll wheel
- **Select Multiple**: Command+click (planned)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Space`: Create new node at center
- `Cmd+N`: New document
- `Cmd+S`: Save document
- `Cmd+Z`: Undo (planned)
